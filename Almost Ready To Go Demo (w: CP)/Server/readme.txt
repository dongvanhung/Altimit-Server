Welcome. This folder is for running the server and the Control Panel.

Running Server:
Step 1: Open a cmd/terminal in this folder.
Step 2: Type "java -jar Altimit_Hazelcast.jar" and press Enter. Hazelcast will start up.
Step 3: Open a second cmd/terminal in the same folder.
Step 4: Type "java -jar Altimit_Server.jar" and press Enter. The Server will run and will say "Ready for clients" when its done.

//NOTE: This will change in the future to just work when the server is ran. Sorry for the trouble.
Running Control Panel:

Step 2: Move the Control Panel files into the web servers html folder.
